# TS to MP4 Batch Converter üé•

A simple and lightweight Python script that uses **FFmpeg** to convert `.ts` (MPEG-TS) video files to `.mp4` format.

‚úÖ Supports:
- Single `.ts` file conversion
- Batch conversion from a folder
- Fast remuxing using `ffmpeg` (no re-encoding, lossless & fast)

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed and added to PATH

---

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Darkwarrior247/TS-to-MP4-Batch-Converter.git
cd TS-to-MP4-Batch-Converter
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Python (if not already)

  `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\video.ts`

- **Batch conversion:**  
  `C:\Users\YourName\Videos\TS_Folder`

### üõ† How It Works
- Uses Python's `subprocess` to run FFmpeg
- Converts .ts files by remuxing (no quality loss)
- Output .mp4 files are saved in the same directory

### ‚ùì Troubleshooting
**FFmpeg not found error?**
1. Verify FFmpeg is installed
2. Confirm the `bin` folder is in your system PATH
3. Restart your terminal/PyCharm after changes

### üí° Future Features
- GUI with drag-and-drop support
- Re-encoding options (quality/bitrate control)
- Detailed logging and error tracking
- Progress indicators for batch conversions
